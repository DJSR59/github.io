		<h1>GitHub.io Introduction</h1>
		<p>Here is a little tutorial for GitHub.io. My name is Dominique Smith-Rodriguez and I am a first year student attending Rochester Institute of Technology. I came from a city named Lebanon, Pennyslvania,<br> and went to Cedar Crest High School before attending here.  I am 5'8", Hispanic, and a pretty active guy.  I enjoy running a lot, especially for competition, but I also like to hang out with friends, play some<br> games, and just chill and laugh sometimes.<br>

		Here are some thing I hope to gain out of this course:
			<ul>
				<li>Learn a software engineer's role on a team or in a company.</li>
				<li>Figure out what skills I need to build in order to become a successful engineer in the future.</li>
				<li>Find those that seek the same goals as I do and collaborate with them.</li>
				<li>Learn and build upon teamwork, public speaking, and collaboration skills.</li>
			</ul>
